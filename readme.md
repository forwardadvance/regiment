# Regiment

A JQuery plugin to equalise the heights of elements.

It can be difficult to get the bottoms of elements to line up nicely. Regiment.js addresses this. All elements will stretch vertically to take on the height of the tallest element.

## Sample Usage

Import jQuery and regiment.js, then do something like:

    $(function () {
      $(".widget").regiment();
    });
